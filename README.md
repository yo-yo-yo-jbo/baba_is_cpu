# Baba Is CPU
This is going to be an unusual blogpost for me.  
Recently I got back into the game [Baba Is You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You). If you don't know the game - I *highly* recommend it.  
In this blogpost, I am going to show to Turing-completeness of the game.

## What is Baba Is You?
Baba Is You is a [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-style puzzle game. It features 2 dimentional levels, in each of them you can manipulate various objects to eventually reach a goal.  
Unlike Sokoban, however, the rules that make up the game are also blocks that could be manipulated.
